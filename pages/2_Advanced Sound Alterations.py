That's because although those three factors significantly influence our ability to detect sound, the real world is complicated and these are not the only factors at play. The shape of your ear, how sound bounces off your body, and even the elevation the sound comes from can change our perception of a sound's origin.<br>Scientists invented a better way that trying to fiddle with the delay, volume, and pitch until sound appeared to come from the desired location. Instead they just measured the sound from every angle around a person by sticking a microphone in both of their ears. Then they used some math to figure out how the sound changed depending on the angle and elevation, and came up with HRTFs.<br><b>Have a play with what they came up with!
